Special cases of the sigmoid function include the Gompertz curve used in modeling systems that saturate at large values of x
and the ogee curve used in the spillway of some dams Sigmoid functions have domain of all real numbers
with return value monotonically increasing most often from 0 to 1 or alternatively from âˆ’1 to 1 depending on convention
